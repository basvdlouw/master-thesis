\chapter{Related Work}
You should find out what other researchers have found out about the problem that you will work on. You do that by searching for scientific sources that relate to the problem that you will work on. Often, the chapter in which you wrote your findings is called `Related Work'. Of course, you can choose another title.

You may conclude this chapter with a subsection in which you show how what you intend to do differs from what has been researched.

Try to structure this chapter around \emph{subjects} (instead of naming the different authors or articles that you found sequentially). The idea is that you (and your readers) get a clear view on what is known, and what is still unknown with respect to the problem.

You can, again, start by copying the related work section from your VAF to this chapter. After having done your research (and often during your research) add what you find.
