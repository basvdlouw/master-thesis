\chapter{Research}
Start by copying everything about your research questions from your VAF. Always rewrite this chapter after you have finished your research results. Often, you will find that you did answer slightly different questions than you thought out before.

\section{Research questions}
In the introduction, you described the overall goal of your research.
Here, you formulate your research questions, and you explain them.

Note that your research questions must be formulated in such a way that you will be able to give meaningful answers in the conclusions of your thesis. The results you have produced must contain the answers to these questions.

In most cases, one main research question with several subquestions works best.

\section{Research method}
Here, you describe the method that you used to find answers to your questions. 

In general, it works well when you describe the method you use for each subquestion.  Therefore, you could opt for an alternative structure, by having subsections for each question, with the method described there as well.

\section{Validation}
You should not only describe how you find answers to your research questions, but also how you validate your work: how you will (try to) prove that your answers are indeed ansers to your questions.

Again, you can explain that for each subquestion, or here, in a separate section.
